# Expo EAS Android Build Failure: Generic Error

This repository demonstrates a common, yet frustrating, issue encountered when building Android apps using Expo's EAS Build service. The problem lies in the lack of specific error messages from the Android build system, making debugging challenging. This example showcases the problematic code and the solution to resolve the build failure. 

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Follow the Expo documentation to set up EAS Build and configure your project.

## Problem

The original `expoBug.js` may contain an error, such as a missing dependency or an incorrect Android configuration within the `app.json` file. This results in a cryptic error message during the EAS build process.

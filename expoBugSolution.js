The solution involves careful review of the app's dependencies and Android configuration. It may also involve installing missing Android SDK components.  Check the logs carefully for hints. If using third-party packages, ensure compatibility with Expo and the current Android environment. The `expoBugSolution.js` provides a possible solution; ensure proper setup of your `app.json` for Android and check all project dependencies.  If using any native Android modules, ensure those are properly configured.
